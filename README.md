ChatApp is a project that I started to get familiar with Websockets and their implementation with Socket.IO.

## Setup Instructions for Development
- Clone the repository
- Install the required Node modules by running `npm install`
- Run `node index.js` or `nodemon index.js` (for automatically restarting your server on changes)
- Open `localhost:3000` on multiple tabs and send a message from one tab to check if it is displayed across all tabs
